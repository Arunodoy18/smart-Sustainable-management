# ==============================================================================
# Alembic Configuration - Smart Waste AI
# ==============================================================================
#
# MIGRATION WORKFLOW:
# ===================
# 1. Generate migration: alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
# 2. Review generated file in alembic/versions/
# 3. Test locally: alembic upgrade head
# 4. Commit migration file to git
# 5. Deploy and run: alembic upgrade head
#
# USEFUL COMMANDS:
# ================
# alembic current          - Show current migration state
# alembic history          - Show migration history
# alembic upgrade head     - Apply all pending migrations
# alembic downgrade -1     - Rollback one migration
# alembic stamp head       - Mark all migrations as applied (recovery only)
# alembic upgrade head --sql > migration.sql  - Generate SQL without applying
#
# CRITICAL RULES:
# ===============
# - NEVER rename migration files after they're committed
# - NEVER delete migration files
# - NEVER modify applied migrations - create new ones instead
# - ALWAYS review autogenerated migrations before applying
#
# ==============================================================================
